As you are aware our University is aggressively on the way for excellence in all the dimensions. We are registering to various government evaluation bodies to make our presence at the national and international level. This will help our students in a great way like various renowned companies will themselves visit our campus and would like to employee our students. For students seeking admission to M.Tech programs, institutes would already be knowing about our institute and this would help in some or the other way.
Students make usp of the institute.
I therefore request all the students of CSE Final year and Third year specially to share with the department their achievements, it does not matter it is a big or a small achivement. What matters is we are moving ahead. For us every opportunity that you grap is precious.
In this regard share your GATE score card whosoever has qualified and also intimate us of your job opportunity as an when you get one.
We would be using this information for NAAC, NIFR etc. Also this information would be used for departmental brochure and we would get a banner printed that we would place on departmental webpage and departmental Notice board. This would encourage your juniors to work hard and and add feathers to the departments crown.
You may provide details to Sheshmani Sir as he is representing our department in placement cell.
Tomorrow hopefully you will get your GATE Score Cards. Submit it in soft copy with Sheshmani Sir.
For Final year students those of you who have got internship/Job should also provide details to Sheshmani Sir.
I asked CR Final year many a times in recent past regarding updated detailed information of students who have got  internship/Job as on date. Hopefully We are in position of providing them NOC's. To the best of my knowledge policy regarding NOC has been finalized, tomorrow I just need to confirm the same with Hon. Director Madam and will let you know. Take things on a serious note and help department and University make its presence on National and International platform.

19/04/2022, 8:22 pm - +91 98391 05362: Do you know *how to build a startup*?😱
Have you ever thought of *starting up right in college*?🙄

Normally students think that starting a startup that too in college can only be done by students of *IITs and NITs*😒 but what if we tell you, there is a startup, started by students of *CSJMU*🤗🙌 which has helped more than *5000 students* nationwide through their LIVE courses, more than *3000 students* through their *internships* and more than *1000 students* through their *communities*.

All this while they are still students of *4th Year, B-Tech in CSJMU*.

We are talking about AnsrCoach, the story started by Adarsh Prakash Srivastava  (CSE-2k18) and Ritika Rai (ECE-2k18) back in 2020.

AnsrCoach is a NASSCOM 10000 startup , with incubation offers from IIM Bangalore and IIT Kanpur.

IEIC, CSJMU recognised this massive success of AnsrCoach and has thus decided to hold a session on *How to start up while still being in college?* in UIET-4, CSJMU Campus.

Through this session, you all will learn about the *exact ingredients* to start a *successful venture*, you'll get to know the *tough journey of building AnsrCoach* and a few students will also get a chance to become the part of our core volunteer group at AnsrCoach.

FILL THIS FORM TO BECOME A PART OF OUR CORE VOLUNTEER TEAM : https://bit.ly/ansrvolunteer

We'll wait for you at 11AM, 20 April 2022 in UIET-4.
